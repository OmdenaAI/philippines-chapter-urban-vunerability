# Noah Data
## Storm Surge
**Storm Surge Hazard maps based on predicted storm surge height.**
### Description
- Storm Surge Advisory 1 (SSA1): 2 meters
- Storm Surge Advisory 2 (SSA2): 3 meters
- Storm Surge Advisory 3 (SSA3): 4 meters
- Storm Surge Advisory 4 (SSA4): 5 meters
**HAZ values in the attribute table correspond to the following.**
### Description
1. Knee deep surge height
2. Chest deep surge height
3. Surge height above the head
## Landslide, Alluvial Fan, and Debris Flow Hazards
### Description
**Landslide hazard maps are simulation from 5 meter IFSAR-derived digital terrain model using methodologies presented in the following scientific papers.**

**Hazard maps show unstable slopes and propagation extent.**  
**Hazard maps do not include deep-seated complex landslides and extremely long run-out debris avalanche.**
### Data specifications
- _Attributes_: 
    - LH = 1: Yellow, build only with continuous monitoring
    - LH = 2: Orange, build only with slope protection and intervention, and continuous monitoring
    - LH = 3: Red, no dwelling zone
## Flood Hazards Based on Forecasts
**All projections are based on rainfall and topology.**
### Flood 100yr
**The hazards are based on flood depth and flow rate based on the topology of the area.**  
**The faster the flow could push the hazard level up.**
### Description
1. Knee deep surge height
2. Chest deep surge height
3. Surge height above the head
